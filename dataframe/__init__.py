	<http://www.cogsci.nl/smathot>

	- `dataframe.DataFrame` is a simple class for tabular data, i.e. data that
	is organized as numbered rows and named columns.
	- `qdataframe.QDataFrame` is a PyQt widget for viewing and manipulating a
	`dataframe.DataFrame`.
	- `qdataframe.Enforce` provides functionality for pseudorandomization. This
	is particularly useful for generating condition/ stimulus lists for
	psychological and neuroscientific experiments.

	Current unittest status: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/smathot/python-pseudorandom.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/smathot/python-pseudorandom)

	## Example 1: Creating and viewing a DataFrame

	~~~ .python
	%-- include: "examples/example-basic.py" --%
	~~~

	## Example 2: Pseudorandomization

	~~~ .python
	%-- include: "examples/example-pseudorandomization.py" --%
	~~~

	## Dependencies

	`dataframe` requires only the Python standard library. Python 2.X and
	Python >= 3.3 are supported. `qdataframe` is compatible with PyQt4 and
	PyQt5.
